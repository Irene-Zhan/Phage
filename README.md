# Phage
A web crawler woking with data from http://phast.wishartlab.com/Download.html.
It pulls out information regarding tail fibers or tail protein from each Bacteroide. 
The detailed.csv file contains information found from the detailed file of the Bacteroide and the summary.csv file contains information from the summary file of the Bacteroide.
Each tail fiber/ protein has a count that shows the number of times it is found, follows by which Bacteroide it was found in and its sequence.
If the count does not match with the number of sequence following, it means that the sequence is repeated and therefore not shown.
